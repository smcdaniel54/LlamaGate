        - time_savings_hours_per_week
        - efficiency_gains (percentage)
        - capacity_improvements
        - quality_improvements

        2. Time savings (hours per week)
        3. Efficiency gains
        4. Capacity improvements (can handle X% more volume)
        5. Quality improvements (error reduction)
        
        Return JSON with all productivity metrics.
